# Getting Started with Superset using Docker

Docker is an easy way to get started with Superset.

## Prerequisites

1. [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
2. [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

## Configuration

The `/app/pythonpath` folder is mounted from [`./docker/pythonpath_dev`](./pythonpath_dev)
which contains a base configuration [`./docker/pythonpath_dev/superset_config.py`](./pythonpath_dev/superset_config.py)
intended for use with local development.

### Local overrides

#### Environment Variables

To override environment variables locally, create a `./docker/.env-local` file (git-ignored). This file is loaded after `docker/.env` and can override any settings.

`SUPERSET_SECRET_KEY` is intentionally unset in the tracked `docker/.env`. Generate a unique key with `openssl rand -base64 42` and store it only in `docker/.env-local` before the first `docker compose up`. The [Docker Compose installation guide](../docs/admin_docs/installation/docker-compose.mdx) has the command. Do not commit that file or the generated value. Every Compose file loads `FLASK_DEBUG=true` from `docker/.env`, so a missing key does not stop the stack: Superset logs a warning and falls back to the publicly known `CHANGE_ME_TO_A_COMPLEX_RANDOM_SECRET`. If you already have a Docker Compose metadata database, follow the re-encryption steps in [UPDATING.md](../UPDATING.md#docker-compose-no-longer-ships-a-secret-key) after setting the new key and before the next `docker compose up`.

#### Python Configuration

In order to override configuration settings locally, simply make a copy of [`./docker/pythonpath_dev/superset_config_local.example`](./pythonpath_dev/superset_config_local.example)
into `./docker/pythonpath_dev/superset_config_docker.py` (git-ignored) and fill in your overrides.

#### WebSocket Configuration

To customize the WebSocket server configuration, create `./docker/superset-websocket/config.json` (git-ignored) based on [`./docker/superset-websocket/config.example.json`](./superset-websocket/config.example.json).

Then update the `superset-websocket`.`volumes` config to mount it.

#### Docker Compose Overrides

For advanced Docker Compose customization, create a `docker-compose-override.yml` file (git-ignored) to override or extend services without modifying the main compose file.

### Local packages

If you want to add Python packages in order to test things like databases locally, you can simply add a local requirements.txt (`./docker/requirements-local.txt`)
and rebuild your Docker stack.

Steps:

1. Create `./docker/requirements-local.txt`
2. Add your new packages
3. Rebuild docker compose
    1. `docker compose down -v`
    2. `docker compose up`

## Initializing Database

The database will initialize itself upon startup via the init container ([`superset-init`](./docker-init.sh)). This may take a minute.

## Normal Operation

To run the container, simply run: `docker compose up`

After waiting several minutes for Superset initialization to finish, you can open a browser and view [`http://localhost:8088`](http://localhost:8088)
to start your journey.

### Running Multiple Instances

If you need to run multiple Superset instances simultaneously (e.g., different branches or clones), use the make targets which automatically find available ports:

```bash
make up
```

This automatically:
- Generates a unique project name from your directory
- Finds available ports (incrementing from defaults if in use)
- Displays the assigned URLs before starting

Available commands (run from repo root):

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `make up` | Start services (foreground) |
| `make up-detached` | Start services (background) |
| `make down` | Stop all services |
| `make ps` | Show running containers |
| `make logs` | Follow container logs |
| `make nuke` | Stop, remove volumes & local images |

From a subdirectory, use: `make -C $(git rev-parse --show-toplevel) up`

**Important**: Always use these commands instead of plain `docker compose down`, which won't know the correct project name.

## Developing

While running, the container server will reload on modification of the Superset Python and JavaScript source code.
Don't forget to reload the page to take the new frontend into account though.

## Production

It is possible to run Superset in non-development mode by using [`docker-compose-non-dev.yml`](../docker-compose-non-dev.yml). This file excludes the volumes needed for development.

## Resource Constraints

If you are attempting to build on macOS and it exits with 137 you need to increase your Docker resources. See instructions [here](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/#advanced) (search for memory)
